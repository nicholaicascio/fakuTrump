# Sidescrolling Shooter

A satirical take on the beef between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. Armed with the deadliest weapon known to mankind, the AR-15, Donald single handedly takes it to Kim and his red army. This was a game we created for our spring break of 2018 as an exercise in Unity game development. It features an expandable platforming and weapon system made by myself with best practices to allow for further development of the game.
